# HeckScore

HeckScore is a score-keeping app for the card game Oh Heck (which goes by many other names too - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh_Hell)

It is also a Django developer's first attempt at a Rails app.

TODO:
* Show some player stats on the home page, like number of games played and won.
* When entering bids, show how many have already been bid that hand.
* Make sure bid and trick inputs are legal. Can't bid higher than the number of cards, etc.
* Better test coverage.
* Make everything prettier.
